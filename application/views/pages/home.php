Welcome to the Medical Information System!
<br><br>
This system was created for my Systems 3 - Information Systems Course at FAMNIT, University of Primorska in Koper, Slovenia.
<br><br>
The system allows Patients to register in order to book appointments and view their medical information or upcoming appointments. 
The system allows Doctors to register under a pre-exisitng organization, book appointments and edit patient medical information which they have previously
created.
