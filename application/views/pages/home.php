Since the beginning of 2020, 215 countries and territories around the globe have reported many cases of the coronavirus COVID-19. 
Since this virus is highly contagious, many different demographics are at risk of testing positive if they do not abide by basic 
rules and procedures to reduce the risk of infection. One of the most emphasized rules is social distancing, which is 
maintaining a greater than usual physical distance from other people. 
This ‘obstacle’ of social distancing is occurring all over the world as societies are unable to function as they used to. 
Several organizations such as educational facilities and businesses are forced to continue their functions online, minimizing contact between their members. 
One specific area that might be very difficult to manage and deliver online is the healthcare system, as a huge part of it is in person appointments between doctors and patients.

For some specific demographics, such as the elderly, pregnant women and people with underlying health 
conditions, medical care is needed more often whether its routine checkups, emergency calls, updating medication prescriptions 
and updating a patient’s medical record/history. With the pandemic changing how safe it 
is to go into crowded, busy places, it can be difficult for people in need of this specific 
medical attention to obtain it as they are at risk of catching the virus and their chances of developing severe illness if 
infected is quite  higher than the average person. If a resolution is found to allow such demographics to access 
their regular healthcare without putting themselves at risk, hospitals which deal with COVID-19 cases will have a 
lower influx of patients on their premises which lowers the rate of transmission of COIVD-19 and lowers the in-hospital
workload for tasks that can be easily done online or at a private medical center/organization.
